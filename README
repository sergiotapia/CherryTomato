Introduction to CherryTomato

Here's an example of how to search for a movie, via it's given numerical ID:
	

    string apiKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ApiKey"];
    var tomatoe = new Tomatoe(apiKey);
 
    //Numerical ID in this case is 9818.
    var movie = tomatoe.FindMovieById(9818);
   
    Console.WriteLine(movie.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(movie.Year);
    foreach (var rating in movie.Ratings)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("{0} Rating: {1}", rating.Type, rating.Score);
    }

    Console.ReadKey();
